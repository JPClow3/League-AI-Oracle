## `1.0` | Transmission Log: Project Philosophy

DraftWise AI is not merely an application; it is an advanced piece of Hextech engineering, a strategic co-pilot designed to augment the tactical mind of a League of Legends player. Our core philosophy is built upon the **"Holographic Hextech"** design paradigmâ€”a dark, professional, and immersive interface that resonates with the high-tech aesthetic of modern esports.

Our design and engineering efforts are guided by three core principles:

*   **Clarity:** Data must be presented with absolute precision. Every piece of advice, every champion statistic, must be instantly legible and understandable.
*   **Responsiveness:** The interface must feel alive and tactile. Interactions should provide meaningful feedback, making the user feel connected to the system.
*   **Immersion:** The user should feel like a professional strategist. From the subtle hex-grid background to the frosted glass panels and cyan glows, every element is crafted to create a premium, focused experience.
